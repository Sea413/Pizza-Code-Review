Outline:
1. We will need RNG 1-6 for a given number of dice. Can be done through math random.
2.) Dice graphics to display results. A single button that generates a random number and inputs it.
3.) We need to be able to store the existing value. As an array seems to make the most sense.
4.) One array for the computer and one array for the player. Or two players.
5.) We will have eight hours so first two hour.
6,) The AI will represent the remaining six hours.
