Outline:
1.) Allow users to choose the toppings and size of a pizza. (Sizes will be trifiling, picayune, abhorrent, and Brobdingnagian)
2.) It will six toppings (Copies of Atari's ET game that was released in 1982, the tears of windows vista users, commons from the onslaught cycle of magic the gathering, bento box leftovers from all the rom com animes, cheese,something besides pizza,Something not pizza. our chef is really good and wants to branch out. You can just choose whatever you want, we are not judging. Expect Bill he judges., Kale (everybody loves Kale))
2.5) Will need a way that users can choose multiple toppings if they would like.
3.) Will need to use a constructor and a prototype. Set the constructor for the pizza and create a selection dropdown for all of the options.
4.) Money options will either be in WoW gold or a matched donation to the charity of your choice.
5.) Will most likely do five specs or something cool like that.
